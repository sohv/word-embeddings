Co-occurrence Matrix Methodology

1. Preprocessing and Vocabulary Building
   - Lowercase text, remove non-alphabetic characters
   - Filter words with frequency < 5

2. Co-occurrence Matrix Construction
   - Sliding window approach with varying window sizes
   - Distance weighting: 1/distance
   - Sparse matrix representation

3. Log Scaling
   - Applied log(1+x) to compress value range
   - Expected values: mean ~0.5-1.0, std ~0.5-2.0

4. Evaluation Metrics
   - Coverage/Sparsity analysis
   - Distribution statistics
   - Inflection point detection
   - SimLex-999 subset correlation

5. Recommendation: Window Size 5
